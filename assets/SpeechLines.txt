Feed me and nobody gets hurt
I knocked something over. You're welcome :3
You work. I nap. Fair trade
I just blinked at you slowly. That’s basically a proposal
I'm not fat. I’m fluffy with opinions
Everything here belongs to me now. Including you :D
I see you're busy... pet me immediately
Are you really working, or just pretending?
I’m plotting something. You’ll find out later.
That mouse cursor... looks suspicious
Running command: DISTURB_HUMAN(); success!
System report: 0% productivity
Activating self-destruct... Just kidding. Or am I?
New update available: Version 2.0 — now with extra fluff
Diagnostic complete: You need more cat in your life
Deploying fur particles... loading... complete
Battery low: Nap required
Compiling... Compiling... Forgot what I was compiling
Suspicious mouse detected on screen. Engaging stalk mode
Firmware update paused due to nap time
You have 237 unread notifications. Ignore them and pet me
I'm the opposite of artificial intelligence - genuine stupidity
Oops! I may have deleted System32, hopefully you won't notice
Why work when you can nap?
