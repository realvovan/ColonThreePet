Leave him alone for some time and he'll start slithering across the screen in boredom!<br/>

Or throw him around your screen because you can do that too!!! (i do not support animal cruelty in any way!!!)<br/>
<br/>
But whatever you do, do not forget that he's a <b>HUNGRY</b> fella, keep him fed please, you don't want trouble, do you :3<br/>

### Umm to have your own kitty either compile the code yourself or download whatever's the [latest release](https://github.com/realvovan/ColonThreePet/releases) is uploaded on github
also right click the pet to close the program (for whatever reason you'd wanna do that ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’)<br/>
